o Chicken/Squashed Chicken

o Tree Frog/Squashed Tree Frog

Things to Look Out For

-Very Basic HUD/UI is there but not implemented. Does not track any stats.

-Cars move forward but they do not continuously spawn while the player advances.

-No audio or special lighting.

-No railroads, trains, etc.

-No lily pads and no real logs, logs are sort of drawn on the model.

-No particle system.

-Car can collide with player but nothing happens aside from the car stopping.

-Chicken doesnt hop but does move a set distance (teleports) whenever the player hits W A S or D.

-No eagle.

-Chicken does not face the correct way when changing directions (always faces forwards).

-The level is continuously generated; grass road and river keep spawning and the area behind the chicken does get destroyed. Within the 
game however, the land seems to spawn a bit oddly but appears correctly the more the player advances.

Download Process

-This project was very difficult to upload for me to upload so many files and folders are in .zip format. For the project to run properly, follow this format:

  -All files should be in the CrossyRoad folder. The folders within each .zip file should be extracted and placed within the folder the   .zip was found in.
  
  -The first things to look for when opening the CrossyRoad folder is Config, Content, Intermediate, Saved, and CrossyRoad.uproject. In    GitHub, Config, Content, and Intermediate are all found in one .zip. The Saved folder had to be split into 3 other .zip folders.
  
  -Inside the Saved folder should be 3 .zip folders: Autosaves, Backup, Config-Logs, and AutoScreenshot.png.

  -Summary:
    - CrossyRoad folder should have: Config, Content, Intermediate, Saved, and CrossyRoad.uproject
    
    - Saved folder should have: Autosaves, Backup, Config, Logs, and AutoScreenshot.png

Conclusion
-This project was very difficult for me. I had a slow and frustrating time trying to figure out a lot of these things only to not get very far. Personally, the worst part about it all is that I feel like I didn't learn much from this project among other things.
