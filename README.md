# CrossyRoad

Assets Imported (Almost all assets were oddly recolored when imported)

o Chicken/Squashed Chicken

o Tree Frog/Squashed Tree Frog

o Mad Wizard/Squashed Mad Wizard

o Hipster Whale/Squashed Hipster Whale

o Grass

o Road

o River

o Blue Car

o Orange Car

o Purple Car (crossy_car)

o Taxi

o Trees (small, med, large, XL)

o Only the chicken, grass, road, river, and a few cars have been actually implemented. All else is in the files but arent in the game.

Things to Look Out For

-Very Basic HUD/UI is there but not implemented. Does not track any stats.

-Cars move forward but they do not continuously spawn while the player advances.

-No audio or special lighting.

-No railroads, trains, etc.

-No lily pads and no real logs, logs are sort of drawn on the model.

-No particle system.

-Car can collide with player but nothing happens aside from the car stopping.

-Chicken doesnt hop but does move a set distance (teleports) whenever the player hits W A S or D.

-No eagle.

-Chicken does not face the correct way when changing directions (always faces forwards).

-The level is continuously generated; grass road and river keep spawning and the area behind the chicken does get destroyed. Within the 
game however, the land seems to spawn a bit oddly but appears correctly the more the player advances.

Conclusion
-This project was very difficult for me. I had a slow and frustrating time trying to figure out a lot of these things only to not get very far. Personally, the worst part about it all is that I feel like I didn't learn much from this project among other things.
